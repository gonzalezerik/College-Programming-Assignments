# CSE-15-Labs-Homework
This is a repository of my assignments and code from CSE 15: Discrete Mathematics

Do NOT copy and paste, you will learn nothing from copying my code (Not to mention it is also considered plagiarism).
This is meant to be a resource for everyone who is having trouble with certain assignments and meant to a resource/guide to help on the assignments.

Look at the code, read, and understand it!
